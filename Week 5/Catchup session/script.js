// External Javascript is preferred over inline javascript because:
// 1. Better cde organization by helping us remove DRY i.e., DRY = "Don't Repeat Yourself"
// 2. Browser caching: When you use an external JavaScript file, the browser can cache it. This means that if a user visits multiple pages on your site that use the same JavaScript file, the browser doesn't have to download it again, which can speed up page load times.
// 3. Separation of concerns: Keeping your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in separate files helps to keep your code organized and maintainable. This makes it easier to read and understand the code, especially for larger projects.
