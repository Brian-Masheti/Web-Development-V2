# JavaScript Event Handling & Interactive Elements Assignment

## Overview

This project is a dynamic, interactive webpage built for the JavaScript Event Handling & Interactive Elements Assignment. It demonstrates JavaScript's ability to create engaging user experiences through event handling, interactive components, and form validation. The webpage includes a button for click events, a slideshow gallery, tabbed content, and a validated contact form, all styled for a modern, responsive look.

Images are sourced from Pexels.com to ensure copyright-free visuals. The project is designed to be fun, user-friendly, and educational.

## Features

### Event Handling

- **Button Click**: Clicking the "Action Button" changes its text temporarily.
- **Double-Click**: Double-clicking the button changes its background color briefly (bonus feature).
- **Hover Effect**: Hovering over a box triggers a scaling animation and logs a message to the console.
- **Keypress Detection**: Typing in an input field logs the pressed keys to the console.

### Interactive Elements

- **Change Button**: Toggles the page's background color and button style.
- **Image Gallery**: A slideshow with "Previous" and "Next" buttons to cycle through three Pexels.com images.
- **Tabs**: Three tabs that switch between different content sections when clicked.
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions for gallery images and hover effects enhance the experience.

### Form Validation

- **Required Fields**: Name and email fields must not be empty.
- **Email Format**: Ensures a valid email format (e.g., user@example.com).
- **Password Rules**: Password must be at least 8 characters.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Error messages appear instantly as you type.
- **Submission**: On valid input, a success alert appears, and the form resets.
