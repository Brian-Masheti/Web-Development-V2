# JavaScript DOM Manipulation Examples

This project demonstrates various JavaScript concepts including DOM manipulation, variable declarations, data types, and loop structures. It serves as a learning resource for web development fundamentals.

## Project Structure
* `index.html` - Main HTML file demonstrating DOM element modification
* `main.html` - HTML file for creating and removing DOM elements
* `dom-script.js` - Script for direct DOM manipulation
* `script.js` - Script for creating and removing DOM elements
* `dom.js` - Examples of different DOM selection methods
* `variable.js` - JavaScript variable types and data structures
* `loops.js` - JavaScript loop structures and examples

## Features

### DOM Manipulation Techniques
* Selecting elements using different methods
* Modifying text content of elements
* Setting element attributes
* Applying inline CSS styles
* Adding/removing CSS classes
* Creating and removing elements dynamically

### JavaScript Fundamentals

* Reference data types (Objects, Arrays)
* Type conversion examples
* Various loop structures with examples

## How to Use
1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open either `index.html` or `main.html` in a web browser
3. Check the browser console (F12) to see additional output
4. Explore the JavaScript files to understand different concepts

## Key Concepts Covered
